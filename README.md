## Hi, I'm Yiran(Steven) 👋

I am a software engineer interested in AI for health. I plan to tackle this challenge through two fronts: lifestyle improvements and personalized medicine. 

- 🐻 I am studying AI and comp bio at Brown University.
- 🌲 I am building a nutrition scanner for groceries products.
