## Hi, I'm Yiran(Steven) 👋

I am a software engineer interested in building database management systems and AI safety tools.

- 🐻 I am studying computer systems and machine learning as a Master's student at Brown.
- 🏠 I am leading the backend development effort for [CozyLink](https://cozy-link.com/), an all-in-one solution for student housing.
- 🧼 I am actively contributing to [CleanLab](https://cleanlab.ai/), a tool for improving machine learning datasets.
- 📝 I write about my software engineering learning journey [here](https://excessive-sea-d3a.notion.site/82575c9d54d547d5b73273c8bd0af4fe?v=10efecee74c54e5d971a0b4315e323ae&pvs=4).
