## Hi, I'm Yiran(Steven) 👋

I am interested in Computer Systems and their application in data analytics.

- 🐻 I am studying Systems and Machine Learning at Brown.
- 🧼 I am actively contributing to CleanLab, a dataset tool for machine learning.
- 📝 I am trying to write about software engineering topics [here](https://excessive-sea-d3a.notion.site/82575c9d54d547d5b73273c8bd0af4fe?v=10efecee74c54e5d971a0b4315e323ae&pvs=4).
